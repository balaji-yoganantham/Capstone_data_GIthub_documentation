  "question": "What should I do if I get a 404 error?",
  "answer": "Answer:\n\nIf you receive a 404 error when making a request to the GitHub API, it indicates that the requested resource could not be found. This error can occur for various reasons, such as:\n\n1. **Invalid endpoint or URL**: Double-check that you are using the correct endpoint and URL. Ensure that you are using the correct HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, or PATCH) and that the endpoint exists in the GitHub API documentation.\n\n2. **Resource not found**: Verify that the resource you are trying to access exists. For example, if you are trying to retrieve a repository, ensure that the repository exists and you have the necessary permissions to access it.\n\n3. **Authentication issues**: Check your authentication credentials, such as your Personal Access Token or OAuth token. Ensure that you have the necessary scopes and permissions to access the requested resource.\n\nTo troubleshoot the issue, you can try the following:\n\n1. **Check the GitHub API documentation**: Review the GitHub API documentation to ensure that you are using the correct endpoint, HTTP method, and parameters.\n\n2. **Verify authentication credentials**: Check your authentication credentials, such as your Personal Access Token or OAuth token, to ensure that they are valid and have the necessary scopes and permissions.\n\n3. **Check the resource existence**: Verify that the resource you are trying to access exists and you have the necessary permissions to access it.\n\n4. **Check the API rate limits**: Ensure that you are not hitting the API rate limits. You can check the current rate limits by making a `GET` request to the `https://api.github.com/rate_limit` endpoint.\n\nAs we discussed earlier, authenticating with the GitHub API using a Personal Access Token or OAuth token is essential to avoid hitting the unauthenticated rate limit and to ensure you have the necessary permissions to access the desired resources.\n\nIf you are still experiencing issues, please provide more details about your API request, including the endpoint, HTTP method, and any error messages you receive. I'll be happy to help you troubleshoot the issue.",
