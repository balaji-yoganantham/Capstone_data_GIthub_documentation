  "question": "hi ",
  "answer": "Hi! It seems like you're interested in creating issues on GitHub using the GitHub API. Based on the response status code and format you provided, I'm assuming you're looking to create a new issue.\n\nTo create a new issue, you can use the `POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues` endpoint. This endpoint requires authentication, so you'll need to provide a valid GitHub token or credentials.\n\nHere's an example of the request:\n\n`POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues`\n\nWith the following JSON payload:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"title\": \"Issue title\",\n  \"body\": \"Issue body\"\n}\n```\n\nThis will create a new issue with the specified title and body. The response will be an `Issue` object in JSON format, and the status code will be `201 Created` if the issue is created successfully.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or need further assistance!",
