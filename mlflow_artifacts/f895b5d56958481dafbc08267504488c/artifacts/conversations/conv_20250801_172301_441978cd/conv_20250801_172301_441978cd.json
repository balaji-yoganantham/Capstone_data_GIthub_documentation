  "question": "give me code for the github ?",
  "answer": "Confidence Score: 90\n\nBased on the provided context and conversation history, I understand that you are asking about the GitHub API endpoint to retrieve a list of repositories. \n\nThe relevant endpoint for this is `GET /user/repos`, which returns a list of repositories owned by the authenticated user. The example cURL request provided in the context is a correct representation of this endpoint.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the request:\n\n* `GET /user/repos` is the endpoint to retrieve a list of repositories.\n* `Authorization: token YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` is the authentication method, which requires a personal access token.\n* `Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json` specifies the response format as JSON.\n* `type=owner` is a query parameter that filters the results to only include repositories owned by the authenticated user.\n* `sort=updated` is a query parameter that sorts the results by the last updated date.\n* `per_page=5` is a query parameter that limits the number of results per page to 5.\n\nTo use this endpoint, you would need to replace `YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` with a valid personal access token.\n\nIn the previous conversation, you asked for code related to the GitHub API, and I'm providing this response as a follow-up to that question.",
