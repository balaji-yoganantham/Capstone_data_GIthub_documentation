  "question": "hello zoro",
  "answer": "Hello again! It seems like you just wanted to say hello, and that's perfectly fine. Since we didn't have a specific question to address, let's revisit our previous conversation about creating issues on GitHub using the GitHub API.\n\nAs a quick recap, we discussed using the `POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues` endpoint to create a new issue. This endpoint requires authentication, so you'll need to provide a valid GitHub token or credentials to avoid rate limit issues.\n\nIf you have any questions or need further assistance on creating issues or any other GitHub API-related topics, feel free to ask, and I'll be happy to help!",
