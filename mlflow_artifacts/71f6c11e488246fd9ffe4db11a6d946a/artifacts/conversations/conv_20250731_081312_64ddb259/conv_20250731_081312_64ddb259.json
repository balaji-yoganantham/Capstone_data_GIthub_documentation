  "answer": "Hi Balaji!\n\nTo create a new repository for the authenticated user, you can use the `POST /user/repos` endpoint. This endpoint requires authentication with the `public_repo` or `repo` scope.\n\nHere's an example of how you can create a new repository:\n\n**HTTP Method:** `POST`\n**Full URL:** `https://api.github.com/user/repos`\n**Request Body:**\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"my-new-repo\",\n  \"description\": \"This is my new repository\",\n  \"private\": false\n}\n```\n**Authentication:** You need to authenticate with a token that has the `public_repo` or `repo` scope.\n\nOnce you send the request, you should receive a `201 Created` status code with the newly created repository's details in the response body.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or need further assistance!",
