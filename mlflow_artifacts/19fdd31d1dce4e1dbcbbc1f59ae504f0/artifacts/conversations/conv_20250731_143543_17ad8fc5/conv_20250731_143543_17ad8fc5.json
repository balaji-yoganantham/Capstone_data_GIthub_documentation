  "question": "hii",
  "answer": "Hi! It seems like you're trying to create multiple issues in a GitHub repository using the GitHub API. You're using the `POST /repos/owner/repository/issues` endpoint to create a new issue with a title, body, labels, and assignees.\n\nTo clarify, you need to authenticate with the GitHub API using a personal access token or OAuth token to create issues. You can pass the token in the `Authorization` header of your request.\n\nIf you want to create multiple issues, you'll need to send multiple requests to the `POST /repos/owner/repository/issues` endpoint with the relevant issue details in the request body.\n\nIf you have any specific questions about this process or need help with authentication, feel free to ask!",
